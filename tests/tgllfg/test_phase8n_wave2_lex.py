"""Phase 8.N: Wave 2 lex pass.

Closes the audit-surfaced lex gaps from Wave 2 (R&C 1990 +
R&G Intermediate + Ramos 1971) and the R&G Conv greeting-cluster
— see ``docs/coverage.md`` § Phase 8 closure summary (formerly
``docs/coverage-audit-2026-05.md`` §§9-11 + §16; rolled up
2026-05-22).

Lex additions (in ``data/tgl/nouns.yaml``):

- ``kumusta``  NOUN  regards, greetings (the noun sense — GT's
                     "respect / regard"). Registered with
                     ``FRAGMENT_HOST: true``; admits the bare
                     ``Magandang kumusta!`` NP head and the
                     interjection ``Kumusta!`` standalone.
- ``palabas``  NOUN  show, performance        (R&G Int. §10 sample)
- ``patyo``    NOUN  yard, patio              (R&G Int. §10 sample)
- ``pelikula`` NOUN  film, movie              (R&G Int. §10 sample)
- ``sanga``    NOUN  branch (of tree)         (Ramos §10 sample)
- ``kahoy``    NOUN  wood, tree               (Ramos §10 sample)
- ``tawad``    NOUN  forgiveness; discount    (R&C 1990 §10 sample)

Lex addition (in ``data/tgl/particles.yaml``):

- ``kumusta``  ADV   how (interrogative, MANNER). Parallel to
                     ``paano`` / ``papaano`` — same wh-ADV cell.
                     Unlocks ``Kumusta ka?`` / ``Kumusta ang
                     pamilya mo?`` (the audit's predicational use).

Verb update (in ``data/tgl/verbs.yaml``):

- ``sabi`` — affix_class extended to include ``magpa``, enabling
  ``nagpasabi`` / ``nagpapasabi`` to compose via the analyzer's
  mag-pa- causative paradigm cell with the existing root
  (lemma stays ``sabi``). Probed in 8.N: extending the affix_class
  is sufficient to lift ``nagpasabi`` / ``nagpapasabi`` /
  ``magpapasabi`` from ``_UNK`` to ``VERB(lemma=sabi)``. The
  infinitive ``magpasabi`` and future-OF ``papasabihin`` remain
  ``_UNK`` — those are general paradigm-cell gaps not specific to
  ``sabi`` (same gap on ``kain``), tracked toward Phase 8.H.

Out of 8.N scope (each surfaces a *distinct* construction-class
or a-structure gap, properly closed in a follow-on sub-PR):

- ``Nagpasabi si Gina na uuwi siya.`` — finite-clause subord +
  SAY-class causative-of-saying argument-structure; Phase 8.O.
  (Pre-8.N this incorrectly fragment-parsed because ``nagpasabi``
  was ``_UNK``; post-8.N it correctly zero-parses, with a
  ``completeness-failed`` diagnostic surfacing the genuine missing
  XCOMP argument.)
- ``Humingi ba ng tawad si Deo?`` — proper-noun lex gap on
  ``Deo``; orthogonal to 8.N.
- ``Tumingin siya sa pelikula.`` — ``tingin`` registered TR (OBJ
  required); the AV form's OBL-via-``sa`` complement-licensing
  is its own a-structure question; orthogonal to 8.N.

Anti-deferral note (Phase 8.N expansion C5): the original 8.N
plan had pinned ``Kumusta ang pamilya mo?`` as out-of-scope on
the rationale "needs new construction rule". A diagnostic probe
showed that rationale was wrong — registering ``kumusta`` as a
wh-ADV (parallel to ``paano``/``bakit``/``kailan``) plugs into the
existing wh-ADV + ang-NP infrastructure with no construction work
required. Per the anti-deferral discipline (Phase 8.Y/8.Z
pattern), the carve-out was closed in 8.N itself rather than
queued as a follow-on. The user's pointer to GT's POS analysis
(ADV "how" + NOUN "respect/regard") was the prompt for the
diagnostic probe.
