# tgllfg/cfg/grammar.py

"""Default Tagalog grammar.

The grammar is V-initial. Sentences are flat ``S → V (NP)*`` rules
that distinguish:

* the verb's voice (``AV`` / ``OV`` / ``DV`` / ``IV``);
* the case of each post-verbal NP (``NOM`` / ``GEN`` / ``DAT``);
* the relative order of the post-verbal NPs (Tagalog freely permits
  ``ang``-NP and ``ng``-NP in either order).

The grammar's case→GF mapping is uniform across all four voices —
``ang``-NP (``NOM``) is SUBJ; ``ng``-NP (``GEN``) is OBJ; ``sa``-NP
(``DAT``) attaches as a member of the f-structure's ``ADJUNCT`` set.
The OBJ analysis of the *ng*-non-pivot in transitive non-AV is
established in Phase 1; Phase 4 generalises it to DV and IV
(``docs/analysis-choices.md`` "ng-non-pivot in transitive non-AV →
OBJ" + "Phase 4 §7.1: voice and case extensions").

``OBL-LOC`` / ``OBL-GOAL`` / ``OBL-BEN`` classification of *sa*-NPs
is deferred to Phase 5 (LMT-driven mapping); for now they ride
through the f-structure as a non-governable ``ADJUNCT`` set, which
sidesteps coherence by design.

The argument-structure secondary features ``APPL ∈ {INSTR, BEN,
REASON, CONVEY, ∅}`` and ``CAUS ∈ {DIRECT, INDIRECT, ∅}`` are
recognised by the grammar (lex_entry templates may carry them), but
no Phase 4 grammar rule consumes them yet — applicatives and
causatives proper land in §7.7.

Phase 4 §7.2 adds clausal negation: ``hindi`` (declarative
``POLARITY=NEG``) and ``huwag`` (imperative ``POLARITY=NEG, MOOD=IMP``)
attach as a left-edge particle to a full ``S``. The matrix
f-structure inherits ``PRED``/``VOICE``/``ASPECT``/``SUBJ``/``OBJ``
from the inner clause and overlays ``POLARITY`` (and, for ``huwag``,
``MOOD=IMP``) from the particle.

Phase 4 §7.4 (ay-inversion) and §7.5 (relativization) introduce a
SUBJ-gapped non-terminal ``S_GAP``: a clause whose surface is
``V (NP[CASE=GEN])* (NP[CASE=DAT])*`` — i.e. an inner S without the
NOM-marked SUBJ argument. Each S_GAP rule binds its missing SUBJ to
``REL-PRO`` via ``(↑ SUBJ) = (↑ REL-PRO)``; an enclosing wrap rule
then sets ``REL-PRO`` from the displaced phrase (the ay-fronted
topic, or the head NP of a relative clause). The SUBJ-only
restriction on relativization is enforced by the wrap rule's
constraining equation ``(↓3 REL-PRO) =c (↓3 SUBJ)``: vacuous today
because S_GAP only has SUBJ-gapped frames, but ready for the
non-SUBJ-gap variants that would arise under §7.6 long-distance or
§7.8 non-pivot ay-fronting.

Phase 4 §7.6 (control & raising) adds ``S_XCOMP``: a separate
SUBJ-gapped non-terminal restricted to ``V[VOICE=AV]`` frames. The
distinction from ``S_GAP`` is voice-coverage: relativization can
have OV / DV / IV embedded clauses (pivot-relativization works in
any voice), but control complements canonically only license AV
embedded clauses (the controllee is the actor, which is SUBJ in AV
only). Control wrap rules attach ``S_XCOMP`` to a control verb plus
its arguments and bind matrix SUBJ to ``XCOMP REL-PRO``. The
control verb's class is discriminated by ``CTRL_CLASS ∈ {PSYCH,
INTRANS, TRANS}`` carried on the V's morph analysis (per-root
``feats`` field on inflected verbs; particles.yaml entry on
uninflected psych predicates).
