"""Clitic absorption rules: 2P enclitics, floated quantifiers, kita fusion.

Holds the rules whose structural signature is "matrix S plus a
clitic / quantifier / enclitic that absorbs into it" rather than
the canonical V-initial argument frame. After the post-Phase-5f
grammar split (see ``docs/refactor-grammar-package.md``) this
module owns:

* Phase 4 §7.8 floated quantifier — ``lahat`` / ``pareho`` /
  ``kapwa`` and similar Q-words that float to the right edge of the
  S, sharing reference with the matrix SUBJ via the ``S → S Q``
  recursive rule.
* Phase 4 §7.3 adverbial enclitics as clausal ADJUNCT members —
  the recursive ``S → S PART[CLITIC_CLASS=2P]`` rule that absorbs
  Wackernagel particles (``na``, ``pa``, ``daw``, ``po``, ``kasi``,
  ...) into the matrix's ``ADJUNCT`` set after the clitics module
  has reordered them into the post-verbal cluster.
* Phase 5e Commit 20 kita clitic fusion — ``V kita`` /
  ``V kita NP`` / ``V kita NP[DAT]`` frames that fuse the 1SG.A +
  2SG.P portmanteau pronoun into the verb's argument structure
  with synthetic SUBJ / OBJ / ADJUNCT mappings.

The composer in :mod:`tgllfg.cfg.grammar` calls this registrar
third, after :mod:`tgllfg.cfg.nominal` and
:mod:`tgllfg.cfg.clause`, and before the negation /
extraction / control / discourse registrars — see the plan's
"Migration strategy" §H.

    #
    # The pre-parse clitic-placement pass moves adverbial enclitics
    # (``na``, ``pa``, ``ba``, ``daw``/``raw``, ``din``/``rin``,
    # ``lang``, ``nga``, ``pala``, ``kasi``, ...) to the end of the
    # sentence in priority order. This recursive rule absorbs each
    # one as a member of the matrix f-structure's ADJ set; the
    # particle's own f-structure (carrying ASPECT_PART, EVID, etc.)
    # rides into ADJ as a sub-structure.
    #
    # ``CLITIC_CLASS=2P`` distinguishes Wackernagel enclitics from
    # the other PART tokens (linkers, the ``hindi`` negation
    # particle).
    # The constraining equation enforces strict CLITIC_CLASS=2P
    # matching: the chart's non-conflict matcher would otherwise
    # accept any PART that simply lacks the CLITIC_CLASS feature
    # (e.g. linker ``na``/``-ng``, decimal ``.`` / ``punto``,
    # arithmetic operators) and absorb them into ADJ at clause-
    # final position. The strict ``=c`` ensures only genuine 2P
    # enclitics fire here. (Tightened 2026-05-04 alongside the
    # digit tokenization closing deferral, which exposed the
    # latent looseness via the new ``.`` PART.)
    # Phase 5i Commit 5: yes/no Q_TYPE lift for ``ba``.
    #
    # Two parallel absorption rules with disjoint pre-conditions:
    #
    # * Rule A (the original Phase 4 §7.3): generic 2P clitics
    #   without QUESTION (na ALREADY, pa STILL, daw REPORT, rin ALSO,
    #   lang, nga, pala, kasi, ...). Constraining ``¬ (↓2 QUESTION)``
    #   excludes ``ba``.
    # * Rule B (Phase 5i Commit 5): ``ba`` (PART[QUESTION=true,
    #   Q_TYPE=YES_NO]) — same shape as Rule A plus a literal
    #   ``(↑ Q_TYPE) = 'YES_NO'`` lift onto the matrix S.
    #
    # The two-rule split is cleaner than a single rule with a
    # defining equation ``(↑ Q_TYPE) = ↓2 Q_TYPE``: the equation
    # creates an empty FStructure on the matrix when ↓2 lacks
    # Q_TYPE, perturbing the f-structure rendering for every
    # non-ba 2P-clitic absorption (baseline test failures across
    # ~20 corpus entries).
    #
    # The lifted matrix-level Q_TYPE pairs with Phase 5i Commits 2
    # / 4 wh-fronting (which set ``Q_TYPE: WH``) so downstream
    # consumers have a uniform clausal-Q-type marker (YES_NO /
    # WH / TAG).

    # --- Phase 5e Commit 20: kita clitic fusion ---
    #
    # Tagalog has a special second-position clitic ``kita`` that
    # fuses the 1sg-GEN actor and 2sg-NOM SUBJ of a non-AV verb
    # into a single token: ``Kinain kita`` "I ate you",
    # ``Sinulatan kita ng liham`` "I wrote you a letter",
    # ``Pinakain kita ng kanin`` "I fed you rice",
    # ``Hindi kita kinain`` "I didn't eat you" (with kita
    # hoisted to the post-V cluster by the Wackernagel pass).
    # The fusion is obligatory — *``Kinain ko ka`` is
    # ungrammatical in modern Tagalog (Schachter & Otanes 1972
    # §3.2; Kroeger 1993 §2.2).
    #
    # Lex: ``data/tgl/pronouns.yaml`` carries a single entry
    # ``kita`` with feats ``{KITA: YES, is_clitic: True}``. The
    # grammar rules here build out the SUBJ and 1sg-actor
    # f-structures from atomic-value equations, since the lex
    # loader doesn't support nested feats.
    #
    # The dual binding sets:
    #
    # * ``(↑ SUBJ PERS) = '2'``, ``(↑ SUBJ NUM) = 'SG'``,
    #   ``(↑ SUBJ CASE) = 'NOM'`` — the 2sg-NOM SUBJ (CAUSEE
    #   in pa- variants; PATIENT / RECIPIENT / THEME in plain
    #   variants).
    # * ``(↑ <obj_target> PERS) = '1'``, ``(↑ <obj_target> NUM)
    #   = 'SG'``, ``(↑ <obj_target> CASE) = 'GEN'`` — the
    #   1sg-GEN actor. The typed slot follows the same
    #   per-voice spec used by the standard non-AV S frames:
    #   OBJ-AGENT for plain non-AV; OBJ-CAUSER for pa-OV /
    #   pa-DV (CAUS=DIRECT).
    #
    # Three frame variants per voice spec:
    #
    # 1. **Bare** (``V kita``): the simplest case, e.g.
    #    ``Kinain kita`` (OV), ``Binasahan kita`` (DV),
    #    ``Ipinaggawa kita`` (IV-BEN), ``Pinakain kita``
    #    (pa-OV: "I fed you").
    # 2. **With overt PATIENT** (``V kita NP[GEN]``): used by
    #    3-arg DV / IV / pa-OV constructions, e.g.
    #    ``Sinulatan kita ng liham`` "I wrote you a letter",
    #    ``Pinakain kita ng kanin`` "I fed you rice".
    # 3. **With DAT adjunct** (``V kita NP[DAT]``): a peripheral
    #    location / recipient adjunct.
    #
    # Note on paradigm coverage: the canonical example
    # ``Nakita kita`` "I saw you" requires an OV-NVOL form of
    # ``kita`` (na- prefix on the transitive root). The current
    # ma-class paradigm only emits AV-NVOL forms; ``nakita``
    # analyses as AV-NVOL only, so the kita-fusion rule doesn't
    # fire for it. Tracked as a paradigm-coverage TBD alongside
    # the DV PFV gap from Phase 5e Commit 18 (see plan §18).
