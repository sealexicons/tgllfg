"""NP rules: determiners, possessives, demonstratives, quantifiers.

Holds every grammar rule whose left-hand side is an ``NP[CASE=...]``
or ``N`` non-terminal. After the post-Phase-5f grammar split (see
``docs/refactor-grammar-package.md``) this module owns:

* NP shells (case from determiner / personal-name marker; demonstrative
  deixis lift)
* Standalone demonstrative pronouns
* Post-modifier and pre-modifier demonstratives
* Cardinal / ordinal NP-internal modifiers
* NP-internal possessive (``ng``-NP wrap)
* Pre-NP partitive (``Q + NP[GEN]``)
* Vague-cardinal / universal (``bawat`` / ``kada``) /
  distributive-possessive / wholes (``buo`` / ``buong``) modifiers
* Measure-N (Group H2 item 4)
* Decimal-cardinal NUM rule
* ``mga`` time approximation
* Approximators (Group H1 item 2)
* Numeric-comparator frames (Group H1 item 3)
* Minute composition (Group E item 4)
* N from NOUN (toy PRED projection)

The ``register_rules`` function appends rules in source order. The
composer in :mod:`tgllfg.cfg.grammar` calls this registrar first
(before clause / clitic / negation / extraction / control / discourse
registrars) — see the plan's "Migration strategy" §H.

The private ``_cardinal_case_marker`` dict is consumed by six
NP-modifier rule groups (cardinal Commit 1, ordinal Commit 7,
vague-Q Commit 15, universal Commit 20, distrib-poss Commit 21,
whole Commit 22). Promoted from a local in the original cardinal
section to a module-level constant per the plan's risk note.

    #
    # Phase 4 §7.8: ``(↑) = ↓1`` shares the NP's f-structure with
    # the determiner / case-marker token, so the DET/ADP's lex
    # features (CASE, MARKER, DEIXIS for demonstratives) all
    # surface on the NP. The toy noun PRED is overlaid via the
    # explicit PRED equation. This is a no-op for non-demonstrative
    # determiners (no DEIXIS feature; CASE/MARKER stay consistent
    # with the rule's case constraint) and lifts demonstrative
    # deixis onto the matrix without per-deixis rule explosion.
    # Phase 6.G Commit 2: SHARE+SHARE pattern (L32). The NP's
    # f-structure unifies with BOTH the case-marker daughter (↓1)
    # and the N daughter (↓2) — propagating CASE/MARKER/DEM from
    # the marker and PRED/LEMMA/SEM_CLASS/SEASON/any-N-internal-
    # modifier-feats from N onto the matrix NP, without empty-
    # f-node pollution. The explicit ``(↑ PRED) = ↓2 PRED`` and
    # ``(↑ LEMMA) = ↓2 LEMMA`` lifts become implicit via the
    # share — dropped. See ``docs/analysis-choices.md`` "Phase
    # 6.G Commit 1" for the empty-f-node analysis.
    #
    # **N-level-RC exclusion** (``¬ (↓2 N_RC)``). The Phase
    # 5n.A C8 N-level RC rule (``cfg/extraction.py``: ``N → N
    # PART[LINK] S_GAP``) was added for existential bare-N RCs
    # (``May bahay na nasa bundok``). Under SHARE+SHARE its
    # output N would feed the simple NP rule, producing a parse
    # that duplicates the canonical NP-level RC wrap (Phase 4
    # §7.5). The N-level RC marks its output with ``N_RC = true``
    # (a binary feat declared in ``core/feats.py BINARY_FEATS``);
    # this simple NP rule's ``¬ (↓2 N_RC)`` blocks it from
    # consuming N-level-RC'd Ns, leaving the NP-level RC path as
    # the unique surface route for case-marked NP-headed RCs.
    # (Negative-existential on a tag feat works at pass-2 because
    # the tag feat is set by the N-level RC's own defining
    # equation; the canonical path's NP-level RC adds ADJ but
    # never N_RC, so the two paths are distinguishable at pass 2.)
    # Additional N-level-modifier exclusion: the N-level cardinal
    # rule below (``N → NUM[CARDINAL] PART[LINK] N``, Phase 5f
    # Commit 1 companion) and other N-modifier compositions
    # produce an N with the modifier's value feat already lifted
    # (``CARDINAL_VALUE`` on N for cardinal; ``DISTRIB`` on N for
    # tig-distrib via paradigm). Under SHARE+SHARE, that N's
    # value feat would propagate to NP via the simple rule —
    # duplicating the dedicated NP-level cardinal / distrib /
    # etc. rules (Phase 5f Commits 1 / 19). The negative-
    # existential guards block the simple NP rule from consuming
    # such pre-modified Ns, leaving the dedicated NP-level rules
    # as the unique surface route for case-marked modifier NPs.

    #
    # ``ang maraming bata`` "many children", ``ng kaunting
    # tubig`` "of a little water", ``sa iilan na aklat`` "to a
    # few books". The vague-cardinal Q sits between the case
    # marker and the head N via the linker, mirroring the
    # Phase 5f Commit 1 cardinal-NP-modifier rule (the plan
    # §11.1 Group H description literally calls Group H rules
    # "the Group A cardinal-NP-modifier rule generalised to any
    # NUM / Q head" — this commit lands the Q variant).
    #
    # Unlike the cardinal rule, the daughter doesn't contribute
    # CARDINAL_VALUE; it contributes ``QUANT`` (MANY / FEW /
    # VERY_FEW / MOST) and ``VAGUE=YES`` rides up to the matrix
    # NP for the LMT classifier and downstream consumers. The
    # constraining equation ``(↓2 VAGUE) =c true`` enforces
    # the daughter is actually a vague Q (lahat / iba would
    # otherwise match by non-conflict on the absence of CARDINAL
    # / ORDINAL / VAGUE).
    #
    # 6 NP-level rules = 3 cases × 2 linker variants. Chained
    # vague Qs (``*ang maraming maraming bata``) are blocked by
    # ``¬ (↓4 VAGUE)`` parallel to the cardinal rule's
    # ``¬ (↓4 CARDINAL_VALUE)``.

    # Three rules total:

    # 1. ``NUM → PART[APPROX] NUM[CARDINAL]`` wraps a

    #    APPROX=YES on the matrix NP.
    # 2. ``Q → PART[APPROX] Q`` wraps a quantifier. Output
    #    is Q (preserving QUANT + VAGUE), so the existing
    #    Phase 5b partitive (``Q + NP[GEN]``) and Phase 5f
    #    Commit 15 vague-Q-modifier rules consume it:
    #    ``halos lahat ng bata`` partitive,
    #    ``halos maraming bata`` linker form.
    # 3. ``NUM → PART[PLURAL_MARKER] NUM[CARDINAL]``
    #    extends the Phase 5f Commit 13 mga rule from TIME
    #    NOUNs to cardinal NUMs. ``mga sampu`` "around ten"
    #    is the target; same surface uses the same lex entry,
    #    different rule.
    #
    # The constraining equation ``(↓1 APPROX) =c true`` (rules

    # (``halos`` / ``humigitkumulang``); ``(↓1 PLURAL_MARKER)

    # Pre-N (``maganda na bata`` / ``magandang bata``) and post-N
    # (``bata na maganda`` / ``batang maganda``) adjective
    # modifiers, both linker-mediated. Four rules total:
    #
    #   N → ADJ PART[LINK=NA] N    pre-N, consonant-final adj
    #   N → ADJ PART[LINK=NG] N    pre-N, vowel-final adj (-ng)
    #   N → N PART[LINK=NA] ADJ    post-N, consonant-final N
    #   N → N PART[LINK=NG] ADJ    post-N, vowel-final N (-ng)
    #
    # Multi-modifier composition (``mabilis na maganda na bata``
    # "quick beautiful child") falls out of right-recursion in
    # the pre-N rules: the rightmost daughter is N, and an
    # adj-modified N is itself N. The two adjectives both end
    # up in the matrix N's ``ADJ-MOD`` set.
    #
    # **Why ``ADJ-MOD`` rather than the canonical ``ADJ``
    # attribute.** This codebase uses ``ADJ`` as a set-valued
    # f-attribute for clausal adjuncts (adverbial clitics in
    # ``cfg/clitic.py``, sentential PP/AdvP fronting in
    # ``cfg/extraction.py``) and as the host slot for relative
    # clauses on NPs. Lifting the head N's adjunct set to the
    # matrix NP via ``(↑ ADJ) = ↓2 ADJ`` would pre-create an
    # empty AVM on every NP whose head N has no modifier — and
    # subsequent ``↓ ∈ (↑ ADJ)`` set-adds (e.g., from the RC
    # wrap rule) would then clash with that empty AVM at the
    # ``add_to_set`` call. Using a Phase-5g-specific attribute
    # name (``ADJ-MOD``) sidesteps the clash because no other
    # rule writes to it. Tests for NP-internal adj modifiers
    # check ``feats["ADJ-MOD"]`` rather than ``feats["ADJ"]``.
    #
    # The category ``ADJ`` in the rule's RHS is the lex
    # preterminal POS (the analyzer's ``MorphAnalysis.pos`` for
    # ADJ-class roots), entirely separate from the f-attribute
    # ``ADJ`` / ``ADJ-MOD`` namespace.
    #
    # The N-level rule (no NP / no case) lets the existing
    # NP-from-N projection at lines 64-90 case-mark adj-modified
    # Ns freely (``ang magandang bata`` / ``ng magandang bata``
    # / ``sa magandang bata``). Avoids the 6-NP-rule explosion

    #
    # The PART ``mas`` (lex feat ``COMP_DEGREE: COMPARATIVE`` —
    # added in particles.yaml in this commit) wraps an ADJ to
    # produce another ADJ marked ``COMP_DEGREE: COMPARATIVE``. The
    # output is itself an ADJ, so the same Phase 5g rules consume
    # it: the predicative-adj clause rule fires on
    # ``Mas matalino siya``; the NP-internal modifier rules fire on
    # ``mas matalinong bata``. No new clause / NP rules.
    #
    # **Equation analysis**:
    #
    # * ``(↑) = ↓2`` shares the inner ADJ's f-structure with the
    #   wrapped output. The inner ADJ's PRED, PREDICATIVE,
    #   ADJ_LEMMA, and any per-cell feats all percolate to the
    #   matrix.
    # * ``(↑ COMP_DEGREE) = 'COMPARATIVE'`` writes COMPARATIVE
    #   onto the shared f-structure. If the inner ADJ already
    #   carries a different COMP_DEGREE (e.g.,
    #   ``pinakamaganda`` carries SUPERLATIVE), unification fails —
    #   ``*mas pinakamaganda`` "more most beautiful" is correctly
    #   ungrammatical.
    # * ``(↓1 COMP_DEGREE) =c 'COMPARATIVE'`` constrains the PART
    #   daughter. Belt-and-braces with the category-pattern
    #   ``PART[COMP_DEGREE=COMPARATIVE]``; the category matcher
    #   already filters, but the explicit constraint matches
    #   the Phase 5e parang / Phase 5g predicative-adj convention.
    #
    # **Why this rule is in nominal.py rather than its own
    # ``cfg/degree.py``**: the wrapped ADJ is consumed by both
    # NP-modifier rules (above this block) and the Phase 5g
    # predicative-adj clause rule. ADJ-wrapping rules sit in the
    # nominal area as a category-rewrite that feeds both clausal
    # and nominal contexts. Phase 5h Commit 5's intensifier-ADJ
    # wrapper joins this same area; if the wrapper-rule cluster
    # grows beyond ~3-4 rules, a dedicated ``cfg/degree.py``
    # split is reasonable.
    #
    # **Top-1 flip risk** (Phase 5h plan §7.2): pre-state probe
    # showed ``Mas matalino siya.`` parsed today via
    # ``_strip_non_content`` silently dropping ``mas`` (a _UNK

    # Closes §18 L41 (formal ``nang higit`` comparison; carried
    # forward from Phase 5h §9.2 — ``mas`` is the standard /
    # colloquial comparative, ``nang higit`` is the formal
    # alternative). Per the §18.2 detail, two resolution paths

    # PART[higit] ADJ``, or extending the Phase 5h Commit 3
    # ``mas`` wrapper to admit the multi-word ``nang higit``
    # particle sequence.
    #
    # **Resolution path chosen**: the wrapper-rule path. ``nang
    # higit + ADJ`` produces an ADJ[COMP_DEGREE=COMPARATIVE]
    # parallel to the ``mas + ADJ`` wrapper output, so the
    # existing Phase 5g Commit 3 predicative-ADJ clause rule and
    # the Phase 5h Commit 4 kaysa wrap consume the result
    # unchanged. This keeps the comparative semantics in one

    # rule that would duplicate the mas / kaysa composition logic.
    #

    # * ``(↑ COMP_DEGREE) = 'COMPARATIVE'`` writes COMPARATIVE
    #   onto the matrix ADJ. Unification with an inner ADJ
    #   already carrying SUPERLATIVE (``pinakamatalino``) fails
    #   — ``*nang higit pinakamatalino`` correctly ungrammatical.
    # * ``(↑ REGISTER) = 'FORMAL'`` marks the formal register
    #   distinguishing this from the colloquial ``mas`` form.
    # * ``(↓1 LEMMA) =c 'nang'`` constrains daughter 1 to the
    #   ``nang`` PART (existing temporal-since lex entry — its
    #   ``COMP_TYPE=TEMP_SINCE`` doesn't leak because ``(↑) =
    #   ↓3`` doesn't share daughter 1's f-structure).
    # * ``(↓2 COMP_PHRASE) =c 'HIGIT'`` constrains daughter 2 to
    #   the ``higit`` PART (Phase 5f Commit 17 numeric-comparator
    #   lex entry). Same lex polysemy — the comparative-clause
    #   path here is gated by the trailing ADJ.
    # * ``(↓3 PREDICATIVE) =c true`` belt-and-braces on the
    #   ADJ daughter (matches Phase 5h Commit 3 / 5 convention).
    #
    # Polysemy safety: ``nang higit + ADJ`` and ``higit sa N``
    # (Phase 5f Commit 17 numeric comparator) don't conflict —

    # the Phase 10.E.1 ``ang``-exclamative.
    #
    # **Structure** mirrors the Phase 5h intensifier-particle wrap
    # directly above (``ADJ → PART[INTENSIFIER] PART[LINK] ADJ``), with
    # a doubled ADJ replacing the particle. ``(↑) = ↓1`` shares the
    # *first* conjunct's f-structure, so its ``LEMMA`` / ``PREDICATIVE``
    # ride up unchanged; the LHS advertises ``PREDICATIVE=true`` so the
    # Phase 5g predicative-ADJ-S rule (and the ay-fronting / pivot
    # rules) admit the complex under the Phase 6.C graph-constraint
    # matcher.
    #
    # **Same-lemma gate** — ``(↑ LEMMA) = ↓3 LEMMA`` forces the two
    # conjuncts to share a lemma by unification clash (``(↑) = ↓1``
    # already carries ↓1's ``LEMMA``). The doubling is what yields the
    # intensive reading; this blocks the unrelated two-adjective linker
    # construction ``mahirap na masarap`` ("difficult but delicious",
    # rg-int sent-1372) from misparsing as an intensive.
    #
    # **Degree feats** — ``COMP_DEGREE=INTENSIVE`` joins the established
    # intensive-adjective class (parallel to the particle wrapper and
    # ``napaka-``); ``REDUP_SEM=INTENS`` is the Phase-10 reduplication-
    # taxonomy tag (informant ruling 2026-05-25: INTENSIVE → INTENS),
    # parallel to the Phase 10.E.1 exclamative. No new feat is minted —
    # the §2.2 ``INTENS_LINKED`` sketch is superseded by reusing the
    # shipped enums per the §2.1.1 ruling.
    #
    # **Belt-and-braces** — ``(↓2 LINK) =c '{link}'`` closes the
    # non-conflict-matcher leak (a bare ``PART`` without ``LINK`` would
    # otherwise absorb the linker slot, exactly as on the particle
    # wrapper); ``(↓1 PREDICATIVE) =c true`` / ``(↓3 PREDICATIVE) =c
    # true`` restrict both conjuncts to genuine predicative adjectives.
    #
    # Clitic placement: ``reorder_clitics`` keeps a post-complex 2P
    # clitic in situ (``_is_post_doubled_adj_pron``) rather than hoisting
    # it between the conjuncts — PK91's A° diagnostic ``*Mabait ka=ng

    # ``mas`` PART (lex feat ``COMP_DEGREE: COMPARATIVE``) wraps a
    # ``Q[VAGUE]`` head (``marami``, ``kaunti``, ``konti``,
    # ``kakaunti``, ``ilan``, ``iilan``) to produce a comparative-Q.
    # The wrapped Q rides into the existing Phase 5f Commit 15
    # vague-Q NP-modifier rule unchanged: ``mas maraming aklat``
    # parses as ``NP → Q[COMP_DEGREE=COMPARATIVE] PART[LINK] N``.
    #
    # **Equation analysis** (mirrors the Phase 5h Commit 3
    # comparative-ADJ wrapper):
    #
    # * ``(↑) = ↓2`` shares the inner Q's f-structure with the
    #   wrapped output (PRED, LEMMA, QUANT, VAGUE all percolate).
    # * ``(↑ COMP_DEGREE) = 'COMPARATIVE'`` writes COMPARATIVE
    #   onto the matrix.
    # * ``(↓1 COMP_DEGREE) =c 'COMPARATIVE'`` belt-and-braces
    #   constraint on the PART daughter (matches Commit 3
    #   convention).
    # * ``(↓2 VAGUE) =c true`` belt-and-braces constraint on the
    #   Q daughter — closes the same kind of non-conflict-matcher
    #   leak Commits 3 and 5 closed (without it, a Q without
    #   VAGUE would absorb the slot).
    #
    # **Why a sibling rule rather than overloading the Commit 3
    # ADJ-wrapper**: the Q and ADJ wrappers have different
    # downstream consumers — Q feeds the NP-modifier and the (not-
    # yet-built) predicative-Q rule; ADJ feeds the predicative-adj
    # clause rule and the NP-internal ADJ-modifier rules. Modest
    # rule duplication is preferable to category-pattern
    # overloading.
    #
    # **What's NOT in scope this commit**: predicative-Q clause
    # (``Mas marami ang aklat.`` "There are more books.") — would
    # need a new clausal rule analogous to the Phase 5f Commit 4
    # predicative-cardinal rule (``Tatlo ang aklat.``). Cardinal
    # comparison via ``mas`` (``*Mas tatlo``) is correctly
    # ungrammatical: cardinals carry ``CARDINAL: YES``, not
    # ``VAGUE: YES``, so the rule's category-pattern + ``=c``
    # constraint does not fire on them.
    # LHS advertises ``VAGUE=true, COMP_DEGREE=COMPARATIVE`` so the
    # Phase 5n.B Commit 1 predicative-Q clause rule (which expects
    # ``Q[VAGUE]``) admits the mas-wrapped Q under the Phase 6.C
    # graph-constraint matcher. ``(↑) = ↓2`` already shares the

    # Productive composition of the Phase 5l ``kahit`` (PART

    # inventory (``sino`` / ``ano`` / ``alin`` / ``saan`` /
    # ``kailan`` / ``bakit`` / ``paano``).
    #
    # Two parallel rules:

    #   ADV  → PART[LEMMA=kahit] ADV[WH]    (IndefADV)
    #
    # Each builds an indefinite PRON / ADV by overlaying
    # ``INDEF=YES`` onto the inner wh-element's f-structure
    # (``(↑) = ↓2``). The ``kahit`` daughter joins the matrix's
    # ADJUNCT set as a member, preserving the c-structure
    # provenance. The ``LEMMA=kahit`` constraint excludes other
    # CONC particles (``bagaman``) from firing as indefinite-
    # builders.
    #
    # Disambiguation with Phase 5l concessive ``kahit S``:
    # the daughter category (S vs PRON/ADV) deterministically
    # picks the right rule. ``Kahit umulan, …`` builds a
    # SubordClause; ``Kahit sino …`` builds a PRON.

    # Reference: R&G 1981 §6.6.
    # Two sibling rule shapes:
    #
    # 1. Bare-PRON LHS — retained for Phase 5m / 5n compatibility:
    #    legacy non-conflict matcher allowed the wrapped PRON to
    #    project to any-case NP via the bare LHS, so e.g.,
    #    ``Kumain siya kahit ano.`` could fit ``kahit ano`` into
    #    the OBJ (CASE=GEN) slot even though ``ano`` is lex'd
    #    CASE=NOM. The lex doesn't carry GEN/DAT variants for the
    #    wh-PRONs, so without this fallback that cross-case usage
    #    0-parses.
    # 2. Per-CASE parameterized LHS — added in Phase 6.C C3d for
    #    the graph-constraint matcher. Advertises CASE so the
    #    NP-from-PRON projection (``NP[CASE=X] → PRON[CASE=X]``)
    #    admits the wrapped PRON under strict matching for the

    # Phase 5n.A Commit 19 (§18 L85 follow-on): tightened the daughter
    # category from bare ``PART`` to ``PART[LEMMA=mismo, EMPHATIC]``.
    # The bare PART version was too permissive — every NP-PART
    # adjacency in the input (e.g., ``si Jose .`` with period PUNCT,
    # or ``Ana at`` in coord-NP contexts) spawned a failed mismo
    # parse path, polluting the Earley chart and blocking 5+-NP
    # coord at the well-formedness pass. The category-level
    # constraint adds defining-equation pressure on the predicted
    # daughter so the parser can prune at predict-time rather than
    # generate-and-filter at unification-time.
    # LHS parameterized over CASE so matrix rules expecting
    # ``NP[CASE=X]`` admit the mismo-attached NP under the
    # Phase 6.C graph-constraint matcher. ``(↑) = ↓1`` already
    # propagates CASE on the f-graph; the LHS pattern advertises
    # it.

    # === 9.X.c21: post-NP topic-marker ``naman`` attachment ============
    #
    # ``Ang ulan naman na kasama nito ay nagpapabaha.`` (R&G 1981
    # PANAHON sent-23). ``naman`` after a NOUN-headed NP functions
    # as a topic-contrast discourse marker ("the rain, however / on
    # the other hand"). Pre-9.X.c21 this surface was blocked
    # because the homophone disambiguator (correctly) selects the
    # non-clitic ``naman`` after a NOUN host, but no NP-internal
    # attachment rule existed to consume it — so it stayed in
    # place between the topic NP and the subsequent linker / ay.
    #
    # Rule shape mirrors the Phase 5m C7 ``mismo`` post-NP rule
    # directly above — set-valued ADJUNCT membership rather than a
    # scalar slot, since topic-contrast is a sentential-discourse
    # marker that scopes over the matrix proposition via its
    # attachment to the topic NP.
    #
    #   NP[CASE=X] → NP[CASE=X] PART[LEMMA=naman]
    #     (↑) = ↓1                head NP supplies CASE / PRED / etc.
    #     ↓2 ∈ (↑ ADJUNCT)       naman joins ADJUNCT set
    #     (↓2 LEMMA) =c 'naman'   lemma gate (excludes other PARTs)
    #
    # Disambiguation: the existing CLITIC_CLASS=2P ``naman`` entry
    # (post-V Wackernagel reading) is morphologically distinct —
    # the disambiguator (``clitics/placement.py``) selects the
    # non-clitic entry when ``naman`` follows a NOUN, and that's
    # the entry this rule consumes.

    # === Phase 5n.A Commit 7: depictive ``mag-isa`` post-PRON via linker (§18 L62+L63) =====
    #
    # ``Nakatira siyang mag-isa sa bahay.`` "He lives by himself in the
    # house" — R&G "Ang Manok" simple #3. The ``siyang mag-isa``
    # constituent is a SUBJ NP: PRON[CASE=NOM] head + bound ``-ng``
    # linker + depictive ADV ``mag-isa`` ("alone / by oneself"). The
    # ADV functions as a depictive secondary predicate over the PRON
    # SUBJ, attaching as an ADJUNCT member of the NP.
    #
    # Distribution: scoped to ``mag-isa`` only via the
    # ``(↓3 MAGISA) =c true`` constraining equation (matches the
    # MAGISA flag set on the ``magisa`` lex entry — Phase 5n.A
    # Commit 5). Future depictive ADVs (e.g., ``siyang mabilis`` "him
    # being-quick", ``siyang madalas`` "him often") would either need
    # additional rules or a more general ``DEPICTIVE=YES`` feat — both
    # deferred until corpus pressure surfaces additional tokens.
    #
    # The matrix-NP overlay ``(↑ MAGISA) = true`` exposes the
    # depictive marker at the NP top level for downstream consumers.

    # bahay na nasa tuktok ng mataas na bundok sa bukid.`` — R&G "Ang
    # Manok" combined essay-paragraph (R&G p. 482). The
    # ``mamang ... nakatirang mag-isa`` constituent is N + linker +
    # ADJ-with-depictive: the resultative ADJ ``nakatira`` is itself
    # modified by the depictive ADV ``mag-isa`` ("alone"). The
    # ADJ-internal composition is structurally parallel to the
    # Phase 5n.A Commit 7 PRON-internal version
    # (``NP[CASE=NOM] → PRON[CASE=NOM] PART[LINK=NG] ADV[MAGISA]``)
    # but at the ADJ level so the result feeds back into the existing
    # Phase 5g Commit 2 NP-internal ADJ-modifier rules
    # (``N → N PART[LINK=N{A,G}] ADJ``).
