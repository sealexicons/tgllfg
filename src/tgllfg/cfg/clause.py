"""Clausal rules: V-initial S frames + predicative clauses.

Holds every grammar rule whose left-hand side is ``S`` and whose
right-hand side is a verb (or copula-like predicative head) plus
its argument NPs / cardinal predicate. After the post-Phase-5f
grammar split (see ``docs/refactor-grammar-package.md``) this
module owns:

* Phase 4 §7.1 V-initial S frames — the canonical AV / OV / DV / IV
  voice templates for transitive and intransitive clauses, plus the
  ``ng``-non-pivot OBJ analysis and the basic ADJUNCT attachment of
  ``sa``-NPs.
* Phase 5e Commit 26 ``parang`` comparative — predicative
  comparison clauses (``parang aso ang bata``, "the child is like a
  dog").
* Phase 5f Commit 4 predicative cardinal — cardinal-as-predicate
  clauses (``Tatlo ang aso``, "the dogs are three").
* Phase 5f Commit 9 arithmetic predicates (Group D) — equality,
  addition, etc. with cardinal arguments.
* Phase 5b multi-GEN-NP applicative frames (IV-BEN) — extended V-S
  templates for benefactive applicatives.
* Phase 5b multi-GEN-NP causative frames (pa-OV / pa-DV direct) —
  extended templates for direct causatives in OV / DV voices.
* Phase 5e Commit 11 multi-GEN-NP plain DV — extended template for
  plain (non-causative) DV with two GEN arguments.

The composer in :mod:`tgllfg.cfg.grammar` calls this registrar
second, immediately after :mod:`tgllfg.cfg.nominal` and before the
clitic / negation / extraction / control / discourse registrars —
see the plan's "Migration strategy" §H.

    # ``Parang aso ang bata.`` "The child is like a dog." The
    # comparative reading of `parang` is structurally distinct
    # from the evidential reading (`Parang umuulan` "It seems
    # like it's raining" — Phase 5d Commit 1). The comparative
    # form takes a bare nominal as the standard of comparison
    # and an ang-NP as the comparee.

    # F-structure shape:
    #
    #   PRED = 'LIKE <SUBJ, OBJ>'
    #   SUBJ = the comparee (the ang-NP)
    #   OBJ  = the standard (the bare N)
    #
    # The bare N projects PRED + LEMMA via the existing
    # ``N → NOUN`` rule, so OBJ ends up with the NOUN's lemma
    # and a NOUN-style PRED.
    #
    # ``parang`` and ``tila`` are typed as ``V`` (per
    # ``particles.yaml`` ``pos: VERB``); the existing Phase 5d
    # Commit 1 evidential rule uses ``V[CTRL_CLASS=RAISING_BARE]``,
    # so this rule mirrors that category.
    #
    # The constraining equation ``(↓1 COMPARATIVE) =c 'YES'``
    # restricts to ``parang`` only — the category-pattern
    # matcher (``compile.py::matches``) is non-conflict, so
    # ``V[COMPARATIVE=YES, CTRL_CLASS=RAISING_BARE]`` would
    # also match ``tila`` (RAISING_BARE without COMPARATIVE) by
    # absorption without the explicit constraint.
    #
    # The existing evidential rule (Phase 5d Commit 1) for
    # ``parang + clause`` continues to fire on ``Parang kumain
    # ang bata`` (parang followed by V, not bare N) — different

    #
    # The kasing- / sing- equative cells (Phase 5h Commit 2) produce
    # ADJ surfaces with ``COMP_DEGREE: EQUATIVE``. The Phase 5g
    # predicative-adj clause rule (above) handles single-NP
    # predicatives (``Kasingganda ang bahay``); these three rules
    # handle the two-NP standard-of-comparison construction where
    # the comparee is NOM-marked and the standard is GEN- or NOM-
    # marked.
    #
    # **Why three rules**: Tagalog freely permits the two NPs to
    # appear in either order (NOM-then-GEN or GEN-then-NOM), and
    # the two-NOM variant is a separate pattern. Rule duplication
    # is preferred over a single permissive rule because the
    # SUBJ ↔ NP mapping is order-dependent (the comparee is the
    # NOM-NP regardless of position; the standard is whichever
    # daughter is non-comparee).
    #
    # **Standard NP analysis**: the comparison standard rides on
    # the matrix's ADJUNCT set with ``ROLE: EQUATIVE_STANDARD``.
    # This parallels Phase 5h Commit 4's ``kaysa`` rule, which uses
    # ``ROLE: STANDARD`` on the kaysa-NP. The two ROLE values are
    # distinct because the constructions are analytically separate:
    # ``kaysa`` introduces an oblique standard for graded comparison
    # (with ``mas``), while the equative standard sits directly in
    # the predicate's argument position without an oblique marker.
    #
    # **Constraining equation** ``(↓1 COMP_DEGREE) =c 'EQUATIVE'``
    # restricts these rules to equative-marked ADJ heads
    # (``kasingganda``, ``singganda``, ``pareho``, ``magkapareho``,
    # ``magkaiba``). Other-degree-marked ADJs (SUPERLATIVE,
    # COMPARATIVE, INTENSIVE, CONTRASTIVE) parse the single-NP
    # predicative form via the Phase 5g rule above; the two-NP
    # frames do not fire on them.

    #   shared f-structure.
    # * ``↓3 ∈ (↑ ADJUNCT)`` — the standard NP joins the matrix's
    #   ADJUNCT set. The grammar's ranker / classifier can find
    #   the comparison standard by walking the ADJUNCT set looking
    #   for ROLE=STANDARD members.
    # * ``(↓3 ROLE) = 'STANDARD'`` — the standard NP carries
    #   ROLE: STANDARD on its f-structure so it's distinguishable

    #   adverbs, etc.).
